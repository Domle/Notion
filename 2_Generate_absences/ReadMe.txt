Generate Pseudoabsences

This folder contains scripts for generating pseudoabsences using various 
target-group approaches, ensuring environmentally stratified designs for 
modeling diazotroph presences and pseudoabsences. 
These methods balance environmental bias and ensure robust data 
preparation for subsequent analyses.

General Strategy
Use the target-group approach (Phillips et al., 2009) to generate 
pseudoabsences for taxa with â‰¥ 14 observations.
Absences are proportionally distributed relative to presences within 
environmental strata of species from a defined target group. 

Total Target Group:
Includes taxonomic records from Phytobase (Righetti et al., 2019) 
within the surface ocean mixed-layer.
Excludes diatoms and dinoflagellates to reduce bias caused by their 
larger size and sampling imbalance.

Group-Specific Target Group:
Uses all locations from the compiled diazotroph database in this study.
Provides a more focused background by considering only diazotroph 
observations.

Cruise-Specific Target Group:
Generates background data from specific cruises using the same sampling methods.
Ensures consistency in methodology and environmental context for background selection.
