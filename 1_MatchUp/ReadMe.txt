ReadMe file for section 1 (1_MatchUp)

Script 1:
This script processes a compiled dataset of diazotroph observations, 
creating both raw ungridded and gridded versions. It performs this 
procedure three times: once with the total dataset and twice by 
separating observations based on taxonomic assignment 
(microscopy-based or sequence-based identification).

Script 2:
This script matches diazotroph observations with environmental 
variables and prepares outputs in both gridded and ungridded/raw formats.

Script 3:
Purpose: Visualize outputs from previous data processing steps and validate 
    data integrity. Specifically, for Script 2, visualize diazotroph presences 
    in temperature-nitrate space.
