ReadMe file for section 5 (5_SDM_prep)

This section of the pipeline focuses on processing Species Distribution 
Model (SDM) projections into monthly and annual temporal resolutions for 
each taxon, and then merging these projections to create 
ensemble-based biogeographies. The resulting outputs provide a 
comprehensive view of species distributions, with both spatial and 
temporal components.


2. Ensemble Biogeographies: Monthly and Annual Resolutions

To calculate the global annual distribution of each species using 
ensemble-based SDM projections and compute the ensemble mean and standard deviation across all ensemble members for both monthly and annual 
time scales. This provides a quantitative assessment of the uncertainty 
and variability in the species' predicted distribution. The mean and 
standard deviation are calculated across the 90 ensemble members, 
providing insight into the consensus of the projections and the 
associated uncertainty.
