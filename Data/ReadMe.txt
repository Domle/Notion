This folder contains the relevant input files for the Species Distribution Modeling pipeline from the Manuscript "Nitrogen fixation increases with diazotroph richness
in the global ocean".

- Diazotroph Database: The input database containing occurrences of pelagic diazotrophs. Can also be downloaded from: https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000635803

- Environmental Predictors: Contains the environmental predictors used in the analysis. Predictors are available as two file formats, .RData and
    .grd file. Both contain the same information

- NitrogenFixationRates: Contains the nitrogen fixation rates. Model-based output from Wang et al. 2019 and in situ measurements from Shao et al. 2023

- TaxonTable: A table containing taxonomies from various diazotroph taxa.
